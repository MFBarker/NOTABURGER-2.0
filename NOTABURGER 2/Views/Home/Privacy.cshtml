        The FitnessGram™ Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. <br />
        The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds.<br />
        Line up at the start.<br />
        The running speed starts slowly, but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal.<br />
        [beep]<br />
        A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound.<br />
        [ding]<br />
        Remember to run in a straight line, and run as long as possible.<br />
        The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over.<br />
        The test will begin on the word start.<br />
        On your mark, get ready, start.
